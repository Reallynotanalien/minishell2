DOING :

Lines from pictures (on phone) don't work because of an error in parsing/build_commands
Here_doc leaks
echo $USER, ctrl+d leaves one fildes open ?


export a='|' doesnt work (is empty). Also fucks shit up
$a doesn't substitute it ("$a: command not found, while it should behave as if there were only whitespaces on line")
Quotation error with wrong conditions

redirections + pipes doesnt work (echo hi | wc > file2)

- replace all instances of ft_strlower by cmd->lower_cmd
- get back to school's printf version (uintptr instead of intptr)
- leaks : fix overwritten malloced variable in exec.c (child_two)(*cmd)->cmd[0] = ft_strlower((*cmd)->cmd[0])()


cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat. Now it sorta crashes. Need to stop with a signal ?
test signals
ctrl+c should bring the history back to the bottom

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell

dans exec.c, child_two, le child_handler devrait peut-être être seulement dans le child ?
