DOING : random missing char

Problems :
- exit (cmd[2])
- leaks
- here_doc
- signals


redirections with builtins (still) doesnt work
Different build_commands
Return values for childs and builtins should work properly. Will require testing once loop is okay. Builtins should not have to handle signals. Check for signals in here_doc however, and return_value also. (returns 1 when ctrl+c, 0 for ctrl+d)
test builtins, -> exit isn't working... for some reason there's cmd[2] when running exit -> might be because of same issue as missing char
**will need to handle !new_env[0]
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO -> segfaults
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
test signals
ctrl+c should bring the history back to the bottom

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
