DOING : unset is not working.... 

error handling. Check return values for builtins, else use waitpid
export test && export test= creates two different variables, echo won't print exported variables somehow, when exporting an existing variable, first time it creates a cpy, second time it segfaults --> it doesn't check last var in env I think. (export -> add_varenv -> is_envar -> ft_getenv) (test export_builtin, unset_builtin.)
*I think there's an issue with how new_env is set...
allocate only when adding new env.

**will need to handle !new_env[0]
verify if export ( test= ) keeps the '=' : It does !
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
Handle errors, cleaning and return values --- Keep a variable with latest error code, maybe ?
Will need to add "check_builtin" function in exec, and rework it accordingly (ex: Will the nb of commands stay the same ?)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
fix history
fix signals
fix ctrl+d (many times)
From time to time it seems like the last letter of cmd gets erased
Make sure everything is cleaned (free(), close())
