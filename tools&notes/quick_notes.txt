DOING : correct errror messages and return values in the parsing/exec -> use new print_error() function

echo hi | cat -e : makes minishell crash 
weird behavior with /, //, /, -> use opendir to know if a file is a directory. If it is, return an error if used as a command. 
quoted options should be valid, but aren't right now
echo "           " | cat -e : this doesn't work

- leaks : fix overwritten malloced variable in exec.c (child_two)(*cmd)->cmd[0] = ft_strlower((*cmd)->cmd[0])()
- here_doc
- signals


cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat. Now it sorta crashes. Need to stop with a signal ?
test signals
ctrl+c should bring the history back to the bottom

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
