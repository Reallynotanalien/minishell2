DO NEXT : change the strategy for printing with export (sort first, then print), test export_builtin, unset_builtin.

verify if export ( test= ) keeps the '='
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
**when exporting a variable which has already been set before, export_builtin will place it at the end of the environment, not where it initially was.
Handle errors, cleaning and return values --- Keep a variable with latest error code, maybe ?
Will need to add "check_builtin" function in exec, and rework it accordingly (ex: Will the nb of commands stay the same ?)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
fix history
fix signals
fix ctrl+d (many times)
