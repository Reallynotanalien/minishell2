DOING : Trying to fix random missing char in cmds

Return values for childs and builtins should work properly. Will require testing once loop is okay. Builtins should not have to handle signals. Check for signals in here_doc however, and return_value also. (returns 1 when ctrl+c, 0 for ctrl+d)
Checking for leaks
test builtins, 
finish init_data, 
cleaning functions (free + close)
**will need to handle !new_env[0]
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
test history
test signals
fix ctrl+d (many times)
From time to time it seems like the last letter of cmd gets erased

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
