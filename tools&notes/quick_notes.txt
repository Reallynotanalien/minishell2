check problems to fix from master. Update master.
Problems :
- childs for builtins
- random missing char
- exit (cmd[2])
- leaks
- here_doc
- signals

exec :
	/*
	1 : créer les pipes (dépendant du nomdre de nodes dans cmd). Vérifier comment gérer les pipes pour les builtins.
	2 : pendant que cmd existe, soit execve, soit builtin.
	3 : **changer les signaux dépendant de la commande !**
	*/


DOING : Trying to fix random missing char in cmds (it seems to be comming from "build_commands". However it might also be coming from a function used in it, for example strdup... The origin could then variate.)

Return values for childs and builtins should work properly. Will require testing once loop is okay. Builtins should not have to handle signals. Check for signals in here_doc however, and return_value also. (returns 1 when ctrl+c, 0 for ctrl+d)
Checking for leaks

test builtins, -> exit isn't working... for some reason there's cmd[2] when running exit
cleaning functions (free + close)
**will need to handle !new_env[0]
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO -> need to wait for builtins to not fork anymore
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
test history
test signals
ctrl+c should bring the history back to the bottom
fix ctrl+d (many times)

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
