DO NEXT : test export_builtin. substitute getenv (ex : in substitutions). Handle the malloc'ed return. Merge everything on master once this is done.

**am confused about t_command. I think builtins could simply take char **cmd instead.
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
**when exporting a variable which has already been set before, this will place it at the end of the environment, not where it initially was.
Make is_envvar(). replace ft_getenv when used in an if statement.
Handle errors, cleaning and return values --- Keep a variable with latest error code, maybe ?
These functions will not redirect input/output. They will read from/write on STDIN/STDOUT, which will need to be redirected if necessary. \/ Check if it really works ! \/
Make sure pipes are handled outside of my functions, even with builtins (in exec)
Will need to add "check_builtin" function in exec, and rework it accordingly (ex: Will the nb of commands stay the same ?)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
