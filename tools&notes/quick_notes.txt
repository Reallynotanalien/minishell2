DOING : Error handling ; with excve -> use waitpid and MACROS (changes whether child exited normally or not) with builtins -> manually set return values.


Checking for leaks
test builtins, 
finish init_data, 
cleaning functions (free + close)
**will need to handle !new_env[0]
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
test history
test signals
fix ctrl+d (many times)
From time to time it seems like the last letter of cmd gets erased

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
