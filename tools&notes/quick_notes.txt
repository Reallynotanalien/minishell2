DOING : test builtins, finish init_data, clean_data, error handling and cleaning functions
: Checking for leaks
: Error handling ; with excve -> use waitpid and MACROS (changes whether child exited normally or not) with builtins -> manually set return values.

error handling. Check return values for builtins, else use waitpid

**will need to handle !new_env[0]
verify if export ( test= ) keeps the '=' : It does !
**need to protect variables from unset ? (ex : HOME, USER...)
Will need to remove quotes (except if quoted themselves) when builting command
Test the behavior of substitutions when $HI=$HELLO
cat | ls : minishell does not behave correctly; it should wait for input for cat.
fix history
fix signals
fix ctrl+d (many times)
From time to time it seems like the last letter of cmd gets erased
Make sure everything is cleaned (free(), close())

valgrind :
 valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --track-origins=yes --track-fds=yes --trace-children=yes ./minishell
